% TMATRIX_POROSITY_MEX compute the T-Matrix response.
%    The T-matrix can either be computed using predefined scenarios or with
%    free parameters.
%
%    T = TMATRIX_POROSITY_MEX(MINERAL_PROPERTIES, FLUID_PROPERTIES,
%    POROSITY, SCENARIO, FREQUENCY, ANGLE, PER_INC_CON, PER_INC_ANI), where
%    MINERAL_PROPERTIES is an N by 3 array with its columns containing
%       the bulk modulus, the shear modulus and solid density as its
%       columns,
%    FLUID_PROPERTIES is an N by 4 array with its column containing fluid
%       bulk modulus, fluid density, rock permeability and fluid viscocity,
%    POROSITY is an N by 1 array containing the rock porosity,
%    SCENARIO a number between 1 and 4 indicating one of the following
%       scenarios:
%    (1): dual porosity, mostly rounded pores
%    (2): dual porosity, little rounded pores
%    (3): mixed pores,
%    (4): flat pores and cracks,
%    FREQUENCY a scalar containing the source frequency,
%    ANGLE a scalar the angle between the wave vector and the axis of symmetry,
%    PER_INC_CON a scalar containing the connectivity fraction and,
%    PER_INC_ANI a scalar containing the anisotropy fraction.
%
%    T = TMATRIX_POROSITY_MEX(MINERAL_PROPERTIES, FLUID_PROPERTIES,
%    POROSITY, ALPHA, V, FREQUENCY, ANGLE, PER_INC_CON, PER_INC_ANI), where
%    ALPHA is the aspect ratios of all the inclusions, and
%    V is the volume fraction of all the inclusions,
%    allows for variable ALPHA, V, PER_INC_CON and PER_INC_ANI. They can
%    either be all constant, or ALPHA and V the same length as the other
%    arrays and PER_INC_CON, PER_INC_ANI constant, or all four parameters
%    the same length as the other arrays.
%
%    The function returns a structure array with corresponding p-velocity
%    (Vp), s-velocities (Vsv and Vsh) , input frequency (frequency and the
%    effective density (rho_eff).
